<a href="https://www.crypt.ee">crypt.ee</a> &gt;&gt; cool website, backend is closed src tho, would be dope if there was a self hostable version.<br>
also the ui is sick af; neomorphic light theme looks fcking cool. also i gotta steal the font <code>Josefin Sans</code> that looks dope<br>
<br>
speaking of design, at the time of writing, this site hasn't got any, it's raw and i think imma keep it that way, maybe i'll switch out the fonts, that's the only thing bothering me rn.<br>
still deciding on how i'm gonna display the <em>"blog"</em>, this is what i hv in mind, create a subdir for all the entries and just use the tree listing as the blog index.<br>
aight imma work on that...<br>
